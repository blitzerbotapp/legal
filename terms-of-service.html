  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>

  <p>Welcome to Shop AI, an AI-powered application designed to help users with their shopping experience through intelligent assistance and recommendations. By downloading or using our app, you agree to comply with and be bound by the following Terms and Conditions. Please read them carefully. If you do not agree with these terms, you should discontinue use of the app immediately.

1. Acceptance of Terms

By accessing or using Shop AI, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to these Terms and Conditions (hereafter, "Terms") in their entirety, as well as our accompanying Privacy Policy. These Terms apply to all users of the app. If you do not accept the Terms, you are not authorized to use Shop AI.

We may offer new features or tools through the app in the future, which will also be subject to these Terms (unless otherwise specified). Continued use of Shop AI after any modifications to the Terms constitutes acceptance of those changes.

2. Eligibility

You must be at least 16 years old to use Shop AI. By using the app, you represent and warrant that you meet this minimum age requirement. If you are under the age of 16, you must discontinue use of the app.

Parents or legal guardians of users under the age of majority are responsible for supervising and ensuring compliance with these Terms if minors access the app under their supervision. Shop AI is not intended for children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under 13. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will take steps to delete such information.

3. Account Registration

No formal account registration is required to use Shop AI. We do not require you to create a username or password, and you will not be asked to log in to access the app’s core features.

Onboarding Information: Upon first use, you may be prompted to provide a name or nickname. This is optional and is used solely for personalization (for example, to address you within the app). This information is not stored on our servers and is not tied to any online account.

Account Security: Since there is no account, you are responsible for maintaining the security of your device. Please ensure that no unauthorized person has access to your device to prevent misuse of the app.

Accuracy of Information: If you do choose to provide any information (such as a nickname or contact email for support), you agree to provide accurate information and to update it as necessary so that it remains correct.

4. Use of the App

Shop AI is designed to provide AI-driven shopping assistance, including personalized recommendations, product search help, and other related tools to enhance your shopping experience. By using Shop AI, you agree to use the app responsibly and in accordance with these Terms and all applicable laws.

When using the app, you may NOT:

Use the app for any unlawful, illegal, fraudulent, or harmful purpose. You agree not to engage in any activity that would constitute a violation of any law or regulation through your use of Shop AI.

Disrupt, interfere with, or compromise the normal functioning of the app. This includes not attempting to exploit any vulnerabilities, inject malicious code, spam the service with automated requests, or otherwise impair the app’s performance for other users.

Attempt to reverse-engineer, decompile, or disassemble any part of the app, its features, or the technologies used. Likewise, you may not attempt to bypass or circumvent any encryption, security measures, or data transmissions employed by the app.

Use the app in a manner that infringes on the rights of others or that could harass, defame, or intimidate any person or entity. This includes not using Shop AI to generate or share content that is offensive, obscene, or invasive of someone’s privacy (even though the app’s primary use is personal assistance, not content sharing).

You are responsible for any content you input into the app and any outcomes of using the app. Misuse of Shop AI can result in termination of your access (see Section 12 on Termination). We reserve the right to take appropriate action if we find that you are using the app in violation of these Terms or any applicable laws.

5. Privacy and Data

We are committed to protecting your privacy. Our data practices are described in detail in our Privacy Policy, which is incorporated into these Terms by reference. Please review the Privacy Policy to understand what information we collect, how we use it, and how we safeguard it.

By using Shop AI, you consent to the collection and use of information as outlined in the Privacy Policy. This includes, for example, the app’s use of a third-party AI service (OpenAI) to process your queries and the handling of subscription payments via Apple’s in-app purchase system. If you do not agree with our data practices, you must not use the app.

Remember that any information or content you provide (such as queries you type into the AI) will be treated in accordance with our Privacy Policy. If you have questions about how we handle data, feel free to contact us as specified in the Privacy Policy.

6. Paid Subscriptions and Billing

Some features or content in Shop AI are available only through a paid subscription (the "Premium" features). By purchasing a subscription, you agree to the following terms regarding fees and billing:

Payment of Fees: You agree to pay all applicable subscription fees as displayed in the app at the time of purchase. Prices are listed in your local currency (as determined by the App Store) and may be subject to applicable taxes or exchange rates.

Auto-Renewal: Subscriptions are billed via the Apple App Store and will automatically renew at the end of each billing cycle (e.g., monthly or annually, depending on your plan) unless you cancel the subscription at least 24 hours before the current period ends. You authorize Apple to charge your designated payment method (such as the credit card linked to your Apple ID) for the recurring subscription fee.

Subscription Management: You can manage or cancel your Shop AI subscription at any time through your Apple App Store account settings. (On your iOS device, go to Settings > [Your Name] > Subscriptions, and select Shop AI to change or cancel your subscription.) When you cancel, the subscription will remain active until the end of the current paid period, and you will not be billed for the next cycle.

Free Trials: If we offer a free trial period for the Premium features, it will be specified in the app. Free trials are available to new subscribers only, and we reserve the right to determine your eligibility for a free trial. If you do not cancel before the trial period ends, your subscription will automatically convert to a paid subscription and the applicable fee will be charged.

Cancellation and Refunds: If you cancel your subscription, you will retain access to Premium features until the end of the subscription period already paid for. All subscription charges are handled by Apple through the App Store. Refund requests for subscriptions are generally governed by Apple’s App Store policies. While we do not guarantee refunds, you may contact Apple support for refund inquiries, or reach out to us if you encounter an issue – we will consider refund requests on a case-by-case basis in line with our policies and App Store guidelines.

Changes to Fees: We reserve the right to change the subscription fees or introduce new fees for additional features in the future. Any change in pricing will be communicated to you in advance through the app or other appropriate means. Price changes for existing subscriptions will only take effect at the start of the next subscription period following notice of the change. If you do not agree with a price change, you may cancel your subscription before the new rate takes effect.

Note: All billing and payment processing is handled by Apple Inc. via the App Store. We do not directly collect or store your payment information (such as credit card numbers). If you experience any billing issues, double-check your Apple ID payment method and subscription status, and contact Apple Support if needed.

7. Disclaimer of Warranties

Shop AI is provided on an "as-is" and "as-available" basis. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we disclaim all warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, regarding the app and its services. This includes, but is not limited to:

No Guarantee of Accuracy or Results: While Shop AI aims to provide helpful and accurate information (including AI-generated responses), we do not warrant or guarantee that any content provided by the app is correct, complete, reliable, or suitable for your specific needs. The AI's recommendations or answers should be used for general guidance and informational purposes only, not as absolute advice.

Availability and Error-Free Operation: We do not guarantee that the app will be available at all times, or that it will be free of errors, defects, malware, or interruptions. There may be times when the app is unavailable due to maintenance, technical issues, or factors beyond our control. We strive to fix bugs and maintain uptime, but we make no promises that your experience will always be flawless.

Fitness for Purpose: We make no warranty that Shop AI is fit for any particular purpose, or that it will meet your expectations. You assume all risk for any actions you take based on information or suggestions provided by the app. Use your own judgment and consider seeking professional advice if you are making significant decisions based on the app’s content (for example, financial or health-related decisions).

Third-Party Services: Any third-party services (such as the AI processing by OpenAI or payment processing by Apple) are outside of our control. We cannot guarantee the performance or accuracy of third-party services, and we are not responsible for any issues attributable to those services.

By using Shop AI, you understand and agree that you do so at your own risk. We do not make any warranties that the app will not have vulnerabilities or that any potential vulnerabilities will be fixed (though we will endeavor to do so). If your jurisdiction does not allow the exclusion of certain warranties, some of the above exclusions may not apply to you — in such cases, our warranties are limited to the minimum extent permitted by applicable law.

8. Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by law, Shop AI and its creators will not be liable for any damages or losses arising from your use of (or inability to use) the app or its features. This limitation of liability applies to all types of damages, whether direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, special, or exemplary. For example, we are not liable for:

Personal Injury or Property Damage: Any injury, harm, or damage to your person or property that may result from using the app.

Loss of Data or Content: Any loss or corruption of data, including if any query or conversation history is lost or if the app fails to store or transmit information.

Loss of Opportunity or Financial Loss: Any lost business opportunities, loss of profits, or other financial losses, even if they result from advice or information obtained through Shop AI. (For instance, if you rely on a product recommendation or advice from the app and it turns out to be unsuitable or incorrect, we are not liable for any consequences.)

Indirect or Consequential Damages: This includes damages that are not directly caused by our actions but may be related to your use of the app, such as stress, inconvenience, or disappointment.

Shop AI’s total liability to you for any claim arising out of or relating to the app or these Terms is limited to the amount (if any) you have paid for the app or its services in the last 12 months, or the minimum amount permissible under law, whichever is lower. If you have not made any payments (e.g., if you only use free features), then we owe you no damages.

Exceptions: Nothing in these Terms is intended to exclude or limit liability that cannot be excluded under law. For example, in some jurisdictions, liability for death or personal injury caused by negligence, or for gross negligence or willful misconduct, cannot be limited or excluded. Similarly, statutory warranties that are by law cannot be disclaimed will remain in effect. In such cases, our liability is limited to the greatest extent allowed by applicable law.

9. AI Usage Guidelines

Shop AI integrates a third-party artificial intelligence service (OpenAI’s ChatGPT) to provide intelligent responses and recommendations. By using the AI features of the app, you agree to the following guidelines and understandings:

Lawful and Respectful Use: You will use the AI features only for lawful purposes and in a manner that is respectful to others. You agree not to input any content that is illegal, harassing, hateful, obscene, or that infringes upon the rights of others (such as copyrighted material you have no right to use, or personal data about someone without consent).

No Misuse or Exploitation: You will not attempt to misuse the AI by tricking it into breaking rules, generating disallowed content, or performing tasks outside its intended scope. If the app imposes limits on the length or frequency of queries, you agree not to circumvent those limits (for example, by using automated scripts).

AI-Generated Content: You understand that the responses and content provided by the AI are generated by an algorithm and may not always be accurate, relevant, or tailored to your situation. The AI might occasionally produce incorrect statements or unexpected results. Use caution and your own judgment when acting on AI-provided information. If you receive any content that appears inappropriate or offensive, please discontinue use and contact support so we can investigate and improve our filters.

No Professional or Critical Advice: The AI’s outputs are for informational and convenience purposes. They do not constitute professional advice (e.g., medical, legal, financial, or expert shopping advice for a specific scenario). Always consider consulting a qualified professional for crucial decisions. We are not liable for any actions you take based on AI-generated content, as noted in Sections 7 and 8 of these Terms.

Content Ownership and Usage: The content you input into the AI remains yours, and you are responsible for it. By entering text or questions, you give us and our AI provider the permission to process that content to generate a response. We do not claim ownership of your queries or the AI’s responses to you. However, be mindful that OpenAI’s service may analyze inputs to improve its model or for compliance purposes, as detailed in our Privacy Policy.

Monitoring and Enforcement: We reserve the right to monitor usage of the AI features (in compliance with our Privacy Policy and applicable laws) to ensure adherence to these guidelines. If we detect behavior that violates these Terms or the AI provider’s policies, we may warn you, restrict your access to AI features, or terminate your use of the app (with or without notice) as described in Section 12.

By using the AI features, you also agree to adhere to any additional usage guidelines or community standards that we may introduce within the app, especially as AI technologies and policies evolve. These guidelines are in place to ensure a positive, safe, and fair experience for all users and to maintain compliance with the requirements set by our AI technology provider.

10. Intellectual Property

All content, features, and materials available on Shop AI – including but not limited to text, graphics, logos, button icons, images, software code, and the overall design and functionality of the app – are the intellectual property of the app’s creators (and/or its licensors) and are protected by applicable intellectual property laws (such as copyright, trademark, and patent laws).

App Name and Branding: "Shop AI" and associated logos or designs are trademarks/service marks of the creators of the app. You are not permitted to use these trademarks without our prior written consent.

Licensed and Third-Party Content: Any third-party libraries, frameworks, or services integrated into the app (for example, the AI engine provided by OpenAI, or the payment interface by Superwall/Apple) remain the property of their respective owners and are used by Shop AI in accordance with their licenses. This Terms and Conditions document does not grant you any rights to those third-party intellectual properties.

User Restrictions: You agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, trade, or resell any part of the app or content provided within the app for any commercial purpose. You may not modify, publish, transmit, reverse-engineer, participate in the transfer or sale of, create derivative works from, or in any way exploit any portion of the app’s content or software, except as expressly permitted by us in writing.

Your Content: Any content that you lawfully input or create using Shop AI (for example, a list or notes you generate for personal use) remains your property. We do not claim ownership of user-generated content. However, by using the app and inputting content, you grant us a license to use, process, and display that content for the purpose of providing the service to you. (This license is necessary for the app to function, for example, to feed your query to the AI and show you the answer.) This license is limited, non-exclusive, and irrevocable only for the duration necessary to provide the service. We do not use your personal content for any other purposes outside of app functionality without your consent.

Any unauthorized use of our intellectual property or the app’s content is a breach of these Terms and may also violate copyright laws, trademark laws, and other regulations. We reserve the right to enforce our intellectual property rights to the fullest extent of the law, which may include legal action and/or reporting misconduct to relevant authorities or app platforms.

11. Changes to Terms

We may modify or update these Terms and Conditions from time to time. Whenever we make material changes to the Terms, we will provide reasonable notice to users. This may be done by posting the updated Terms within the app, updating the "Last updated" date, or through other communications (like an in-app notification or an email if we have your contact information).

Continued use of Shop AI after changes are made to the Terms signifies your acceptance of the revised Terms. If you do not agree to the updated Terms, you must stop using the app. We encourage you to review the Terms periodically to ensure you understand the conditions that apply to your use of Shop AI.

For minor changes that do not substantially affect your rights (such as clarifications or typo corrections), we may not send a specific notification, so please check the Terms occasionally. If you have any questions about the Terms or any changes made, feel free to contact us for clarification.

12. Termination

We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to Shop AI, at our sole discretion and without prior notice, under the following circumstances (among others):

Violation of Terms: If you breach any provision of these Terms or our Privacy Policy, or if we suspect that you are engaging in fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful activity, we may deactivate or delete your access to the app (including any Premium subscription benefits, without refund if the termination is due to your misconduct).

Discontinuation of Service: We may decide to discontinue the Shop AI app or any part of its services. If this happens, we will attempt to provide advance notice to active users when feasible (for example, via an announcement in the app or on our website). In the event of discontinuation, your rights under these Terms will end, and we will have no further obligation to provide the service.

User Request: Since we do not maintain user accounts, you can effectively terminate your use of Shop AI at any time by simply discontinuing use of the app or uninstalling it from your device. If you wish to terminate any ongoing subscription, you must cancel it via the App Store as described in Section 6.

After termination or deletion of the app from your device, certain provisions of these Terms will survive. For example, all clauses relating to Limitation of Liability, Disclaimer of Warranties, Intellectual Property, and Governing Law will remain in effect, as well as any other clauses that by their nature should survive termination.

We are not liable to you or any third party for termination of your access to the app under these Terms. If your access is terminated and you believe it was in error, you may contact us to request reinstatement, but we make no guarantee of reinstatement once an account or access is terminated.

13. Governing Law

These Terms and Conditions, as well as any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with Shop AI or its use, are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of [Your Country/Region], without regard to its conflict of law principles. This means that the laws of the specified jurisdiction will apply to any issues concerning interpretation, validity, or enforcement of these Terms.

By using Shop AI, you agree that any legal action or proceeding related to the app or these Terms will be brought exclusively in the courts of the specified jurisdiction (unless otherwise required by consumer protection laws applicable in your region, which might allow you to bring an action in your local courts). You consent to the personal jurisdiction of such courts and waive any objections (such as inconvenient forum) to the exercise of jurisdiction over you by those courts.

If any provision of these Terms is found to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, that provision will be deemed severable from the Terms and will not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions. Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights.

Thank you for choosing Shop AI. We aim to assist you with intelligent shopping solutions while safeguarding your rights and privacy. If you have any questions or need further clarification on either the Terms and Conditions or the Privacy Policy, please reach out to us at [support@shopaiapp.com]. Happy shopping!</p>
